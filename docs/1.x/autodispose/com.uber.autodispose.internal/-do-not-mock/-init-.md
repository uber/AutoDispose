`DoNotMock(value: `[`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)`)`

This annotation indicates that a given type should not be mocked. This is a copy of what was in Error-Prone's annotations artifact before it was removed, but left for documentation purposes.

This has been modified to have CLASS retention and is only applicable to TYPE targets.
