/**
 * Entry point for auto-disposing {@link Maybe}s.
 * <p>
 * The basic flow stencil might look like this:
 * <pre><code>
 *   myThingMaybe
 *        .to(new MaybeScoper<Thing>(...))
 *        .subscribe(...)
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * There are several constructor overloads, with the most basic being a simple {@link
 * #MaybeScoper(Maybe)}. The provided {@link Maybe} is ultimately what every scope resolves to under
 * the hood, and AutoDispose has some built-in understanding for predefined types. The scope is
 * considered ended upon onSuccess emission of this {@link Maybe}. The most common use case would
 * probably be {@link #MaybeScoper(ScopeProvider)}.
 *
 * @param <T> the stream type.
